# LilyGO-T-display-S3-setup-and-examples
LilyGO T-Display S3 setup and examples for Arduino IDE.
These instructions DO NOT WORK for other LilyGO boards, especially the 
similarly named LilyGO T-Display, or LilyGO T-Display S3 AMOLED !

Here is what I found that works.
Included in this GitHub repository are detailed setup instructions and several
working, tested, examples.
 
Installation is "easy" if you know "exactly what to do!"

Press the green Code button to download this repo and expand the .zip file.
Then follow the setup text instructions in "LilyGO T-Display-S3 Setup.txt"!
